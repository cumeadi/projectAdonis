We have sub-folders for docs: primarily papers; ipynb: which contains subfolders like EDA, with notebooks organized into chronological order; data: where all data files should live; src: any helper or utility files; and results: notebooks which contain any final pipelines or models, both in serialized Pickle for or in notebooks which can be replicated.

Credit card fraud is a major issue for customers but even more detrimental for companies in the credit ecosystem. There’s an opportunity to leverage data around transactions to help predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. 
After further analysis, due to the rare occurrence of fraudulent transactions, we recommend to business:
--We identify the true cost of fraudulent transactions
--If a transaction looks like it might be a fraudulent transaction, we should verify with the customer to validate if it was  indeed them who facilitated the transactions. 

If we do this, we can decrease the number of fraudulent transactions by adding validation to questionable transactions. 


This repository contains information on the dataset used, the notebooks used for analysis, and the presenation.
